# Consensus21 x Network School ‚Äî Collaboration Plan

## Overview
This partnership between **Consensus21**, **Network School**, and **Boneo Primary School** aims to co-create innovative, student-led learning experiences using cutting-edge tools like Minecraft, AI, and decentralized governance. The following four action points represent the first phase of collaboration.

---

## 1. Launch a 24/7 Minecraft Education Server

**Goal:**  
Establish a persistent, shared Minecraft Education server where students from Consensus21, Network School, and Boneo Primary can collaborate on educational projects, design challenges, and creative learning missions.

**Features:**
- Safe, cross platform environment  
- Cross-school builds aligned to curriculum goals  
- Creative missions around design, coding, and AI  
- 24/7 access for asynchronous and global learning

**Why it matters:**  
This creates a playful, immersive, and collaborative space for students to learn from one another and build a sense of global community.

## 2. Run an In-Person Workshop at Network School

**Goal:**  
Deliver a hands-on workshop at **Network School** introducing the **Consensus21 Protocol**, with a focus on:

- **Multisignature governance** (3-of-6 voting model replacing traditional principals)  
- **Learner voice and agency** (students proposing their own projects via SIPS ‚Äì School Improvement Proposals)  
- **Open-source curriculum** and **GitHub-based digital portfolios**

**Why it matters:**  
This gives Network School‚Äôs team a practical understanding of how to implement participatory, decentralized, and transparent school models ‚Äî while empowering learners and their families.

## 3. Set Up a 24/7 Classroom Video Link

**Goal:**  
Create a permanent, always-on video conferencing link (a "magic mirror") between **Boneo Primary** and **Network School** classrooms to allow spontaneous conversations, shared activities, and peer learning.

**Implementation Ideas:**
- Mounted displays in shared spaces (like maker spaces or lunch areas)  
- Scheduled "cross-school chats" or creative show-and-tells  
- Open channel during core hours for ambient interaction

**Why it matters:**  
This helps students build meaningful cross-cultural friendships, see other ways of learning in real time, and feel connected to a broader learning community.

## 4. Collaborate on a Student AI Research Program

**Goal:**  
Invite Network School to join a research-based AI learning program you‚Äôre co-leading this term with schools and universities. The program focuses on student-led use of AI, data sovereignty, and ethical tool-building.

**Student Involvement:**
- Running and customising **local LLMs** (not relying on ChatGPT or OpenAI)  
- Learning **prompt engineering** and AI creativity techniques  
- Building tools, games, or media with AI  
- Contributing to real educational research outcomes

**Why it matters:**  
This gives Network School‚Äôs students the opportunity to engage in emerging technology with confidence, ethics, and creativity ‚Äî while contributing to new research in education.
